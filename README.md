# home-manager
Manage my config files with [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager).

## Goals:
[x] Doesn't completely rely on Nix & Home-Manager.
[ ] Easy deployment across devices through Nix.
[ ] Provide separate (dev) environments.
[ ] Provide flakes to remotely run single programs.
